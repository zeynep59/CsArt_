CSART is an interactive and responsive website page about art pieces throughout the world. In this website, user can make research about art of their liking, can make comments and save prefered post of art to view again.
CSART contains art from almost every art period. Therefore CSART is a good resource for research.
CSART uses php, MySQL, html and css to properly arrange every aspect of front and back end  of the website.  
With HTML we made the head and the body of the pages. With CSS we added style and made preferred parts more profound.
In MySQL we use tables such as;

•	Artist(to show every artist mentioned in website)

•	Categories(that shows posts/art Works from every country)

•	Comments(comments from a specific user)

•	Log ins(This one is for the dashboard. This states every log in from users)

•	Posts(Every post with its every detail)

•	Saved(saved art Works form a specific user)

•	Users(Every user)
With php we coded the back end part of the website. This accounts for

•	Every MySQL searches for listings.

•	Every detail of the websites such as links, pages etc.
